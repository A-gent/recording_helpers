L4D2 Recording Helpers
======================

This client plugin is simply a set of useful modifications and functions to help making recording from demos easier and more feature filled.

Features
==
- Re-enables many hidden CVars on L4D2 by removing DEVELOPMENTONLY flags from them. 
- Re-enables a native thirdperson(shoulder) mode in gamemodes with player-controlled zombies.


Usage:
==
Place the files in your l4d2 addons folder and launch the game with -insecure in order to load it.

It may be useful to make a shortcut to l4d2 that launches with -insecure, so you don't have to edit your launch parameters all the time.
e.g. make a shortcut to "C:\Program Files\Steam\steam.exe" -applaunch 550 -insecure
